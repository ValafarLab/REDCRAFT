What is REDCRAFT?
=================
REDCRAFT is an open-source software tool for determining a protein's structure using `residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_dipolar_coupling>`_.
It allows simultaneous determination of a protein's structure and dynamics.
Its effectiveness has been demonstrated on both synthetic and experimental data.
REDCRAFT contains stages that allow the incorporation of user-specified dihedral angle constraints,
such as those produced by TALOS or a restriction to specific regions of Ramachandran space.
It is robust with respect to noise and missing data.
The program is highly efficient and can produce a structure for an 80-residue protein within minutes.
