REDCRAFT is principally used to manipulate data containing informations 
about polypeptides into a PDB (protein database) file for visualization
in software such as PyMOL.

REDCRAFT allows protein structure estimation from RDC (Residual Dipolar Couplings) data extracted via NMR.
This method of data extraction is much cheaper than other traditional methods, and REDCRAFT allows you to
find a structure that is very close to the true structure, within <20 ångströms.
